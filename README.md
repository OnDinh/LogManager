## Install

1) Install via composer:

``` bash
$ composer require backpack/logmanager
```

2) For Laravel <5.5 apps, add the service provider to your config/app.php file:

```
    Backpack\LogManager\LogManagerServiceProvider::class,
```

3) Add a "storage" filesystem in config/filesystems.php:

```
// used for Backpack/LogManager
'storage' => [
            'driver' => 'local',
            'root'   => storage_path(),
        ],
```

4) [Optional] Configure Laravel to create a new log file for every day, in your .ENV file, if it's not already. Otherwise there will only be one file at all times.

```
    APP_LOG=daily
```

or directly in your config/app.php file:
```
    'log' => env('APP_LOG', 'daily'),
```

5) [optional] Add a menu item for it in resources/views/vendor/backpack/base/inc/sidebar.blade.php or menu.blade.php:

```html
<li><a href="{{ url(config('backpack.base.route_prefix', 'admin').'/log') }}"><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> <span>Logs</span></a></li>
```

## Usage

Add a menu element for it or just try at **your-project-domain/admin/log**

## Contributing

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Overwriting Functionality

If you need to modify how this works in a project: 
- create a ```routes/backpack/logmanager.php``` file; the package will see that, and load _your_ routes file, instead of the one in the package; 
- create controllers/models that extend the ones in the package, and use those in your new routes file;
- modify anything you'd like in the new controllers/models;

## Security

If you discover any security related issues, please email :author_email instead of using the issue tracker.
